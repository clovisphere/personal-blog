# About this blog
It'll mostly be about programming. Think of it as my "love letter" to the discipline of software engineering, 
and my way of giving back to the community.

### Talking to me
I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), I  don 't tweet much but I do read tweets, my handle is [clovisphere](https://twitter.com/clovisphere) - don't be shy.
My email address is clovis.mugaruka@gmail.com (no spam, please).

### About me
I'm Clov (Clo' works too) or Clovis if you want (a bit too formal, don't you think?),
I am a software engineer, born and raised in [D.R.Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo), 
but I live and work in [Nairobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi).

I have been a [Quality Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_engineering) for most of my career,
mostly focusing on [exploratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing), 
[performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing) 
and [automation](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/automation-testing-tutorial-1/) testing. Most of 
the things I know about "software engineering", I owe it to my days doing **testing**. I like to say that
_[I fell into the magic testing potion when I was a little boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Obelix_Fell_into_the_Magic_Potion_When_He_Was_a_Little_Boy)_.
