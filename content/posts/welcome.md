# Little things..
When I joined college, the class of 2007 had the below slogan.. 

> (Aspire to) inspire before you expire.\
> -- Eugene Bell, Jr.

For some reason, it stayed with me, and to this day, it still resonates with me.

This blog is ~~partly~~ because of that "slogan". I hope the "little" I say or do (here)
_touches a soul_, or _inspires_ one to start a blog.

Thank you for stopping by!
